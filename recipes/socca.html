    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Farinata, socca, torta di ceci, or cecina is a type of thin, unleavened pancake or crÃªpe made from chickpea flour. 
        It originated in Genoa and later became a typical food of the Ligurian Sea coast, from Nice to Sardinia and Elba islands. 
        It is also typical in Gibraltar, where it is called calentita.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>50cl water</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>250g chickpea flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Provide two plates of about 40 cm in diameter or one of 70 cm.</li>
        <li>In a deep bowl, put the cold water and whisk in the chickpea flour.</li>
        <li>Add two tablespoons of olive oil and a teaspoon of fine salt. Mix vigorously to remove lumps. If necessary, sift.</li>
        <li>The batter should have the consistency of whole milk. If it is too thick, add a little water and mix again.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven on maximum position for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>On one or two circular plates, pour the contents of four tablespoons of olive oil. Divide and bake for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven, pour the preparation and spread it evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake immediately, in the top of the oven.</li>
        <li>After 2 minutes, turn the thermostat to the grill position. Leave to cook for 5 to 7 minutes, so that the crust is golden brown, 
            even a little burnt in places... During cooking, you can pierce the blisters that form with a knife.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, cut and serve, making sure to season with plenty of pepper.</li>
    </ol>
